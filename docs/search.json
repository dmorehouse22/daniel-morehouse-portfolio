I also want to have points within the line to indicate the day of collection throughout the 10-day period.\n\nWhat is missing from your data or what would you need to change in your data to make this possible?\n\nNothing is missing from the data, but I will need to filter out a lot of insignifcant data to make it easier to interpret and code."

What variables? How?\n\nYES, rather than sample ID, I need to create a variable of sponge type (I can do so using the mutate() function)\n\nAre there any variables you can exclude from your data?\n\nPlenty!"
