I want to get familiar with coding as an aspiring marine biologist, since data organization is a quite the task without it. I hope to work in conservation/restoration one day, ideally somewhere where it’s warm. For fun, I love to spend time with friends, be outside in nature, SCUBA dive, and watch sports - go Mets!\n\nAbout this site\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
